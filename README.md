# twitch-bot

A python implementation of the Twitch chat API.

To use replace the asterix's (*) in configs.py with the appropriate values.

You will need to create an account for your bot to use, or use your own account, and visit https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to get an 
oauth token and copy that into the appropriate field. Owner should be set to the main owner of the bot (usually the channel the
bot is deployed to, but not neccecarily.)
